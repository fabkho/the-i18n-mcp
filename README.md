An MCP server that gives your AI agent full control over your app's translations — without dumping entire locale files into context.

Point it at a Nuxt or Laravel project and your agent can read, write, search, rename, and remove translation keys across all locales and layers. It auto-detects your framework, discovers monorepo structures, and handles the file I/O so the agent never has to parse JSON or PHP arrays manually.

### Why this exists

Managing translations with an AI agent sounds simple until you have 30 locales, 6 layers, and 4,000 keys. Pasting locale files into chat doesn't scale. This server exposes 15 purpose-built tools that let the agent work surgically — touching only the keys it needs.

### What you get out of the box

- **Auto-translate entire locales** — `translate_missing` batches keys to an LLM via MCP sampling, writes results back, and shows a progress bar. 1,000+ keys across 13 locales in minutes, not hours.
- **Add a new language in one shot** — the `add-language` prompt walks your agent through config updates, file scaffolding, and bulk translation end-to-end.
- **Safe, atomic writes** — every file write goes through a temp file + rename cycle. Indentation is preserved, keys are kept alphabetically sorted, and `{placeholders}` / `@:linked` refs are validated before writing.
- **Smart caching** — config detection and file reads are mtime-cached. Writes invalidate automatically. Repeated tool calls are fast.
- **Monorepo & layer-aware** — discovers all Nuxt apps and layers under a project root. Each layer's locale directory is a first-class citizen with its own tools scope.
- **Framework-agnostic tooling** — same 15 tools work for both Nuxt (JSON) and Laravel (PHP arrays). Auto-detection means zero config for most projects.
- **Project-aware translations** — drop a `.i18n-mcp.json` with your glossary, tone rules, and per-locale notes. The agent uses them in every translation request.
- **Dead key cleanup** — find orphan keys not referenced in source code, see exactly where keys are used, and bulk-remove unused translations in one step.

> **Migrating from `nuxt-i18n-mcp`?** The old package name still works — both `npx the-i18n-mcp` and `npx nuxt-i18n-mcp` point to the same server. No breaking changes.

## Supported Frameworks

| Framework | Locale Format | Auto-Detection | Config Source |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Nuxt** (v3+) | JSON | `nuxt.config.ts` with `@nuxtjs/i18n` | `@nuxt/kit` (optional peer dep) |
| **Laravel** (9+) | PHP arrays | `artisan`, `composer.json`, `lang/` directory | Built-in |

The server detects your framework automatically based on project structure. You can also force it via `"framework": "laravel"` or `"framework": "nuxt"` in `.i18n-mcp.json`.

## Quick Start

### 1. Configure your MCP host

No install needed — your MCP host runs the server via `npx`.

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code / Cursor</strong></summary>

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "the-i18n-mcp": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-i18n-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Zed</strong></summary>

Add to `.zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "context_servers": {
    "the-i18n-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-i18n-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop</strong></summary>

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-i18n-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["the-i18n-mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### 2. Ask your agent

That's it — no configuration needed. The server auto-detects your project structure, locales, and layers. Just ask:

> *"Add a 'save changes' button translation in all locales"*
>
> *"Find and fix all missing translations in the admin layer"*
>
> *"Rename `common.actions.delete` to `common.actions.remove` across all locales"*
>
> *"Add Swedish as a new language and translate everything"*

## Typical Workflows

### Day-to-day translation maintenance

```
1. detect_i18n_config        → understand project structure, locales, layers
2. list_locale_dirs           → see available layers with file counts and key namespaces
3. get_missing_translations   → find gaps between reference locale and targets
4. add_translations           → add new keys (requires layer param)
   translate_missing          → auto-translate missing keys via MCP sampling
5. find_orphan_keys           → find keys not referenced in source code
   cleanup_unused_translations → remove orphan keys in one step
```

Always call `detect_i18n_config` first — all other tools depend on the detected config.

### Adding a new language

Use the `add-language` prompt for a guided workflow, or do it manually:

```
1. Add the locale to your framework config (nuxt.config.ts or config/app.php)
2. scaffold_locale            → create empty locale files with key structure from default locale
3. translate_missing          → auto-translate all keys from the reference locale
4. get_missing_translations   → verify zero gaps remain
```

`scaffold_locale` copies every key from your default locale and sets all values to `""`. This gives `translate_missing` the complete key set to work with.

## Tools

Every write tool requires a `layer` parameter (e.g., `"root"`, `"app-admin"`, `"lang"`). Use `list_locale_dirs` to discover available layers.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `detect_i18n_config` | Auto-detects framework (Nuxt or Laravel), returns locales, layers, directories, and project config. **Call first.** |
| `list_locale_dirs` | Lists locale directories grouped by layer, with file counts and top-level key namespaces |
| `get_translations` | Reads values for dot-path keys from a locale/layer. Use `"*"` as locale for all locales |
| `add_translations` | Adds new keys to a **layer** across locales. Fails if key already exists. Supports `dryRun` |
| `update_translations` | Updates existing keys in a **layer**. Fails if key doesn't exist. Supports `dryRun` |
| `remove_translations` | Removes keys from ALL locale files in a **layer**. Supports `dryRun` |
| `rename_translation_key` | Renames/moves a key across all locales in a **layer**. Conflict detection + `dryRun` |
| `get_missing_translations` | Finds keys present in reference locale but missing/empty in targets. `""` counts as missing |
| `find_empty_translations` | Finds keys with empty string values. Checks each locale independently |
| `search_translations` | Searches by key pattern or value substring across layers and locales |
| `translate_missing` | Auto-translates via MCP sampling (batches of 50 keys by default), or returns context for inline translation when sampling is unavailable. Supports `batchSize` override. Each locale writes to its own file — parallel calls targeting different locales are safe |
| `find_orphan_keys` | Finds keys not referenced in source code. Scans Vue/TS for Nuxt, Blade/PHP for Laravel |
| `scan_code_usage` | Shows where keys are used — file paths, line numbers, call patterns |
| `cleanup_unused_translations` | Finds orphan keys + removes them in one step. **Dry-run by default** (`dryRun: true`) — pass `dryRun: false` to actually delete |
| `scaffold_locale` | Creates empty locale files for new languages. Copies key structure from default locale with all values set to `""`. Supports JSON (Nuxt) and PHP (Laravel) |

### Prompts

| Prompt | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `add-feature-translations` | Guided workflow for adding translations when building a new feature. Accepts optional `layer` and `namespace` |
| `fix-missing-translations` | Find and fix all missing translations across the project. Accepts optional `layer` |
| `add-language` | Add a new language end-to-end: update framework config, scaffold locale files, translate all keys, and verify. Requires `language` (e.g., `"Swedish"`, `"sv"`) |

### Resources

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `i18n:///{layer}/{locale}` | Read a locale's translations for a specific layer (e.g., `i18n:///root/en-US`) |

## Framework-Specific Details

### Nuxt

- Auto-detects `nuxt.config.ts` with `@nuxtjs/i18n` via `@nuxt/kit`
- Supports monorepos: discovers all Nuxt apps under the given `projectDir`
- Supports Nuxt layers: each layer's locale directory becomes a separate layer
- Requires `@nuxt/kit` as a peer dependency (already present in Nuxt projects)
- Scans `.vue`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.mts` for `$t()`, `t()`, `this.$t()`

### Laravel

- Auto-detects Laravel projects via `artisan`, `composer.json`, or `lang/` directory
- Supports both `lang/` (Laravel 9+) and `resources/lang/` (legacy) layouts
- Reads and writes PHP array locale files (`return ['key' => 'value'];`)
- No additional dependencies required — works out of the box
- Scans `.blade.php` and `.php` for `__()`, `trans()`, `trans_choice()`, `Lang::get()`, `@lang()`
- Uses `:placeholder` syntax (not `{placeholder}`) — reflect this in your `translationPrompt` and `examples`

## Monorepo Support (Nuxt)

The server discovers all Nuxt apps with i18n configuration under the given `projectDir`. Pass the monorepo root and it walks the directory tree, finds every `nuxt.config.ts` with i18n settings, loads each app via `@nuxt/kit`, and merges the results. Each app's locale directories become separate layers.

```
monorepo/
├── apps/
│   ├── shop/          ← discovered, becomes "shop" layer
│   │   └── nuxt.config.ts (has i18n)
│   └── admin/         ← discovered, becomes "admin" layer
│       └── nuxt.config.ts (has i18n)
├── packages/
│   └── shared/        ← skipped, no nuxt.config with i18n
└── package.json
```

Flat layouts work too — `app-shop/` and `app-admin/` at the project root are discovered the same way. Discovery stops descending into a directory once it finds a `nuxt.config` — nested Nuxt layers are loaded by `@nuxt/kit` automatically.

## Model Selection for Translations

`translate_missing` uses [MCP sampling](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/sampling) — the host (VS Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop) picks which LLM fulfills the request. The server sends `modelPreferences` hinting toward fast, cheap models since translation is high-volume and doesn't require frontier reasoning.

**How batching works:** each batch sends up to 50 keys (configurable via `batchSize`) to the host LLM. Locales are processed sequentially within a single call — but since each locale writes to its own file, you can call `translate_missing` once per locale in parallel for faster throughput. A progress bar tracks completion across all locales and batches.

**Built-in defaults** (used when no `samplingPreferences` in `.i18n-mcp.json`):

| Priority | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| `hints` | `["flash", "haiku", "gpt-4o-mini"]` | Fastest models across providers (substring match) |
| `speedPriority` | `0.9` | Users watch a progress bar — latency matters |
| `costPriority` | `0.8` | Hundreds of batches add up |
| `intelligencePriority` | `0.3` | Translation needs quality, not reasoning |

Override via `samplingPreferences` in [`.i18n-mcp.json`](#project-config) if needed (e.g., to prefer a stronger model for nuanced locales).

**Controlling the model in VS Code:**

1. Command Palette → **MCP: List Servers** → select `the-i18n-mcp` → **Configure Model Access**
2. Restrict to your preferred model (e.g., only Gemini 2.5 Flash)
3. Your main chat/agent session continues using whatever model you chose — the restriction only applies to sampling requests from this MCP server

> **Tip:** For large translation runs (1,000+ keys), restricting to a fast model like Gemini 2.5 Flash significantly reduces wall-clock time. A batch of 50 keys typically completes in 10–20s with Flash. You can increase `batchSize` up to 200 for fewer round trips, but larger batches risk hitting the host's request timeout. For maximum throughput, call `translate_missing` once per locale in parallel — each locale writes to its own file, so concurrent calls are safe.

## Project Config

Optionally drop a `.i18n-mcp.json` at your project root to give the agent project-specific context. Everything is optional — the server passes them to the agent, which interprets the natural-language rules. The server walks up from `projectDir` to find the nearest config file (like ESLint or tsconfig resolution).

For IDE autocompletion, point to the schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/the-i18n-mcp/schema.json"
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `framework` | Force framework detection: `"nuxt"` or `"laravel"`. Normally auto-detected from project structure |
| `context` | Free-form project background (business domain, user base, brand voice) |
| `layerRules` | Rules for which layer a new key belongs to, with natural-language `when` conditions |
| `glossary` | Term dictionary for consistent translations |
| `translationPrompt` | System prompt prepended to all translation requests |
| `localeNotes` | Per-locale instructions — terminology constraints, formality, regional conventions. **Keys must match your locale codes exactly** (case-sensitive) |
| `examples` | Few-shot translation examples demonstrating project style |
| `orphanScan` | Per-layer config for orphan detection: `scanDirs` (overrides auto-discovered dirs) and `ignorePatterns` (glob). Keys are layer names from `list_locale_dirs` |
| `reportOutput` | `true` for default `.i18n-reports/` dir, or a string for a custom path. Diagnostic tools write full output to disk and return only a summary in the MCP response |
| `samplingPreferences` | Override model preferences for `translate_missing` sampling. See [Model Selection](#model-selection-for-translations) |

## Roadmap

- [ ] `find_hardcoded_strings` — detect user-facing strings not wrapped in translation calls
- [ ] `move_translations` — move keys between layers (e.g., promote to shared)
- [ ] Glossary validation — check translations against glossary terms
- [ ] Flat JSON support — `flatJson: true` in vue-i18n config
- [ ] Pluralization support — vue-i18n plural forms and Laravel `trans_choice`
- [ ] Plain vue-i18n support (without Nuxt)

## Development

```bash
pnpm build          # Build via tsdown → dist/index.js
pnpm test           # Run all tests
